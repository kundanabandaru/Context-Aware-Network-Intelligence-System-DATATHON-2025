# Context-Aware-Network-Intelligence-System-DATATHON-2025
This project addresses the challenge of managing highly volatile time-series network traffic (VLAN 106 and VLAN 06) by building a Context-Aware Dual-Output Deep Learning Model. We move beyond reactive alerting to provide preemptive Congestion Forecasting and forensic Anomaly Classification.
